    """Run the example: Connect to a Zurich Instruments device via the Data Server,
    configure some settings on the instrument, obtain a single demodulator
    sample via getSample(), calculate and add its RMS amplitude as a field to
    the ``sample`` dictionary and return that dictionary.

    Note:

      This is intended to be a simple example demonstrating how to connect to a
      Zurich Instruments device from ziPython. In most cases, data acquisition
      should use either ziDAQServer's poll() method or an instance of the
      ziDAQRecorder class, not the getSample() method.

    Requirements:

      Hardware configuration: Connect signal output 1 to signal input 1 with a
      BNC cable.

    Arguments:

      device_id (str): The ID of the device to run the example with. For
        example, `dev2006` or `uhf-dev2006`.

      amplitude (float, optional): The amplitude to set on the signal output.

    Returns:

      sample (dict): The demodulator sample dictionary with additional demod R
        and demod phi fields calculated in the example, it contains only one
        demodulator sample point.

    Raises:

      RuntimeError: If the device is not "discoverable" from the API.

    See the "LabOne Programing Manual" for further help, available:

        Programs -> Zurich Instruments -> Documentation
      - On Linux in the LabOne .tar.gz archive in the "Documentation"
        sub-folder.
